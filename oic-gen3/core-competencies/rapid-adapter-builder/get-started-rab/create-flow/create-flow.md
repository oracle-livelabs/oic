# Create Integration Flow

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create an Integration flow.

This use case describes how to use Oracle Integration to consume **Acme OM App** adapter which connects with **ACME Order Management Application**
   - ACME OM App exposes Customers and Orders API
   - OIC consumes the **Acme OM App Adapter** to get a **Customer Order** given a customer\_id.
   - OIC captures the response and sends order details to the client

 The following diagram shows the interaction between the systems involved in this use case.

## Task 9: Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations on successfully completing the **Get Started with Rapid Adapter Builder** Live Lab! You've taken an important step in expanding your Oracle Integration skills by learning how to build custom adapters for applications exposing RESTful APIs.

Through this hands-on workshop, you gained valuable experience with the Rapid Adapter Builder and its Visual Studio Code extension. Here are the key learnings you can takeaway:

- Initializing a structured workspace for adapter development projects
- Configuring publisher profiles to authenticate with Oracle Integration instances
- Importing and testing API collections/specifications in preparation for adapter generation
- Understanding the anatomy of an Adapter Definition Document (ADD) and its sections
- Generating initial ADDs from Postman collections or OpenAPI specifications
- Customizing the adapter definition metadata to tailor the adapter's behavior
- Validating ADDs to ensure they are error-free before publishing
- Registering and publishing custom adapters to Oracle Integration instances
- Verifying the successful deployment of published custom adapters

With this knowledge, you are now equipped to efficiently create adapters that allow Oracle Integration to connect to a wider range of applications and services based on their REST APIs. This enhances OIC's integration capabilities, simplifying connectivity while reducing development overheads.

Well done on completing this tutorial, and keep exploring the powerful features of the Rapid Adapter Builder as you embark on more complex integration projects!
