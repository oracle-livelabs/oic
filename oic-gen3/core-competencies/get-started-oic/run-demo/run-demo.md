2.  Connect with File Server using any FTP Client example: FileZilla. Place the *sales_orders.csv* file in the folder **/home/users/`<your-folder-name>`/Output**

## Task 2: Run the Scheduled Integration Flow

Submit an adhoc run of Scheduled Integration Flow

1. From the *Integrations* page, hover over the Integration Flow, click on **...** (Actions) menu, click on **Run** and again click on **Run**.

## Task 3: Verify sales orders records in ADW Table
Follow these steps to view the sales orders record in the designated DB table.

1. If you are not already logged in to Oracle Cloud Console, log in and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** from the navigation menu.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/adb-navigation.png)

> **Note:**  You can also directly access your Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing service in the **Quick Actions** section of the dashboard.

2. Navigate into your demo database by clicking on the instance link.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/select-adb-instance.png)

> **Note:**  Similar steps apply to either Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing.

3. In your ADW Database Details page, click the **Database Actions** button.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/click-database-actions.png)

4. Sign in with your database instance's default administrator account, Username = `ADMIN` and click **Next**.

   ![Enter DB username](../setup/images/enter-username.png)

5.  Enter the **ADMIN** password and click **Sign in**.

    ![Enter DB password](../setup/images/enter-password.png)

6. The Database Actions page opens. In the *Development* box, click **SQL** or right click on **SQL** and click on **Open Link in New Tab**.

    ![Open SQL](../setup/images/open-sql.png)


7. The SQL Worksheet appears. In the *Navigator* on the left, select the **V\_SALES\_ORDERS** table, then right-click on **Open**.
    ![Open SO table](images/open-so-table.png)

    This opens the *ADMIN.V\_SALES\_ORDERS* table window.

8. Click on **Data** in the left menu to display the table data. Verify your inserted Sales Orders records.
   ![Show SO data](images/show-so-data.png)

## Task 4: Verify sales orders file in Object Storage

Verify sales orders file archived in OCI Object storage

1.  Navigate to *Oracle Cloud Console* Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Storage**, and select **Buckets**.
    ![Select Object Storage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/storage-buckets.png)

2.  Select the **Compartment** and Click on the Bucket example: *bucket-demo* created earlier.

3.  In the list of *Objects* notice **sales_orders.csv** file uploaded. The object storage is used as intermediary storage to import data set in ADW. From the adapter configuration page, you can always select to delete the file after the operation if required.
