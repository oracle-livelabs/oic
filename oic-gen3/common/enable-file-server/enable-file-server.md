# Enable File Server

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the process of enabling the Oracle Integration 3 File Server. By default, the File Server is not enabled, but is required for this workshop.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Enable File Server.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Successfully provisioned Oracle Integration 3 Instance and able to access the home page.

## Task 1: Enable File Server

- An administrator must enable File Server before an organization can start using it with their Oracle Integration instance. Enabling File Server is a one-time action in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

    If your organization hasn't enabled File Server yet, and you select File Server from the navigation pane, the following message appears: *Start sharing files...*

    To enable File Server:

1. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, select the region in the upper right where you created your Oracle Integration 3 instance. Open the navigation menu in the upper left and click **Developer Services**. Under **Application Integration**, click **Integration**.
2. If needed, select the compartment where you created your Oracle Integration 3 instance. You should see your instance.

3. Select your instance.
   The Integration Instance Details page is displayed.
4. Click the Enable link for File Server on the Integration Instance Information tab.

6. Once complete, the OIC icon changes back to green with an Active status, and File Server shows as Enabled. You may need to log out and log back in to Oracle Integration to access the newly activated File Server.
