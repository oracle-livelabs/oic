1. Starting at the Oracle Integration *Home* page, select **Settings**, then **File Server** from the left Navigation pane.
2. Select **Settings** from the left Navigation pane to open the File Server Settings page and review the File Server status and configurations. Make a note of IP and port number.

## Task 2: Connect to File Server with FTP Client

To access files on the File Server you will need to use an FTP Client. You will need to configure your FTP Client with the following:

* File Server IP Address.
* File Server Port.
* Your Oracle Integration username.
* Your Oracle Integration password.

1. To obtain the File Server IP Address and Port, select **Settings** from the left Navigation pane. The IP and Port are located in the *IP and Port Information* section of the *Settings* page.
2. Using your FTP Client choice, connect to the File Server using the SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol.

If the permissions are configured correctly, you should be able to list, read, and write files on the *Output* folder.


You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
