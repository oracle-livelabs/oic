# Create Robot

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a end-to-end robot. When creating a robot, you define its trigger and the actions that the robot performs.

Estimated Lab Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a Robot
* Specify Input and Output Triggers
* Install the Robot Designer Extension
* Add Robot Actions

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Completed the Robot Connection
* Chrome Browser with manage permission

## Task 1: Create a Robot

When you create a robot, you define its trigger and the actions that the robot performs.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Projects** and then click on the project created in the previous lab.

2. On the right side of the page, go to the **Robots** box and click **+ (Add)**.

3. In the **Create robot** panel, fill in the following fields:
    | **Field** | **Required** | **Value** |
    | --- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Name          | Yes | Enter a name for the robot connection type For example: `LiveLabs Robot`       |
    | Identifier    | Yes | This entry is autogenerated based on the Name value.  |
    | Version       | Yes | Keep as default: `1.00.00` |
    | Description   | No  | Provide additional information about the robot.|
    | Keywords      | No  | Enter text that people might use to search for the robot. |

## Task 2: Specify Input and Output Triggers

The trigger defines the interface for the robot, including the input (incoming request) and the output (outgoing response). For this lab, we will provide a purchase order number as input, and capture the supplier name as output.

1. Select ![Create robot panel](images/click-to-edit-trigger-button-small.png " ") **(Click to edit trigger)**

    The trigger panel will appear on the screen.

2. On the **Input** tab, click **+ (Add)** and enter the following Input property values:

    * Name: `PONumber`
    * Type: `String` (default)

3. Select the **Output** tab, click **+ (Add)** and enter the following Output property values:

    * Name: `SupplierName`
    * Type: `String` (default)

4. Click **OK**.

## Task 3: Define Open Application Action

This action tells the robot to open a web browser and navigate to the Oracle ERP Cloud sign-in page. We will use the robot connection created in the previous lab to pull the service URL and credentials.

1. Double-click on the **Open Application** action.

    ![Select robot connections button](images/robot-designer_open-browser_edit.png " ")

2. In the **Open Browser** panel, keep the default values for **Name** and **Description**.

3. We will assign the target URL dynamically using a Robot Connection. On the **Input** tab, select within the **URL** field and click on the **Robot connections** icon ![Select robot connections button](images/robot-connections-button.png " ").

    The **Robot connections** side panel will appear, with the previously created robot connection.

4. Returning to the **Robot connections** side panel, expand the newly created Robot Connection. Next, drag the **URL** parameter to the matching field under the **Input** tab.

    ![Drag the URL parameter to the Input tab](images/robot-designer_open-browser_assign-url.png " ")

5. Under **Browser**, select the browser which will be used by the robot. Keep all other values as default.

6. Click **OK** when done, then **Save**.

## Task 4: Add Login Action

Start the robot by adding the Login action.

1. On the Robot Designer canvas, hover over the **Open Application** action and click on the **+** which appears below it.
![Add Open Application action](images/robot-designer_open-application_add-action.png " ")

    A menu of available actions appears.

2. From the **Actions** tab, select the **Login** action.
![Add Login action](images/robot-designer_open-application_add-login.png " ")

    The **Login** action appears on the canvas.

3. On the **Login** panel, within the **Username** field, select **Robot connections** ![Select robot connections](images/robot-connections-button.png " "). On the Robot connections side panel, expand the created robot connection and drag the `username` parameter to the **Username** field.
![Assign username](images/robot-designer_login_assign-username.png "")

4. Repeat these steps by dragging the `password` parameter to the **Password** field.

    Next, we will specify input details for Username and Password actions.

5. In another browser window, open the sign-in page for the Oracle Fusion environment that the robot will work in. For example, to access Oracle Cloud ERP, your login URL pattern will be:
`https://<Fusion-domain>.fa.<data-center>.oraclecloud.com/fscmUI/faces/FuseWelcome`

6. Return to the **Login** panel on the Robot window, click within the **Username locator** field, and select **Target a page element** ![Target a page element button](images/robot-taget-page-button.png).

    > **Note**: The rest of the workshop requires the **Robot Designer Extension** on your Chrome browser. This extension is used for Targeting and Recording, which allows you to harness the power of control and power of the low-code capabilities. This extension must be installed in order to build robots.

7. If you see below message while following the previous step, then complete the extension installation. After installing the browser extension, we can start creating targets when adding actions to a robot.

    ![Browser extension not detected](images/robot-designer_browser-extension-missing.png)

    Follow these steps to install the Browser Extension:

    * Click on the **Download browser extension** button and wait for the download to complete.
    * Navigate to the location of the downloaded ZIP file, such as your **Downloads** folder.
    * Move the ZIP file to a local folder of your choice, such as ```Users\<user>\RPA\plugin```
    * Extract the ZIP file to the designated plugin folder.
    * In Google Chrome, open the **Extensions** menu, and select **Manage Extensions**.
    * Make sure you are in **Developer mode** using the slider on the top right corner.
    * On the **Extensions** page, select **Load unpacked**.
    * Navigate to the folder containing the unzipped files, select the *target* folder, and click on **Select Folder**.

    This installs the Robot Extension in your Chrome browser.

    ![Loaded Robot extension](images/robot-extension_loaded.png " ")

    Close the **Extensions** tab and return to the Robot. Click **Save**, reopen the project and return to the previous step.

    > **Note**: If the extension fails to load, then save all your work and restart the browser window. Next, navigate to the Robot and reopen the **Login** action.

8. On the **Target a page element** panel, select the target browser window to the Oracle Fusion login page with title `Sign In`, and click **Go**.

    ![Robot input username locator select](images/robot-input_username-locator_select.png)

    This starts the design Targeting on the ERP Cloud login page. This component pops up at the bottom of the Fusion Application window:

    ![Robot design Targeting](images/robot-designer_targeting-on.png "")

9. On the Oracle Fusion login page, point to the `User ID` field where the robot will enter the user name.
    > **Note**: When using the targeting component, wait until the target icon appears, the field turns green, and your mouse icon changes to a hand before selecting the UI element. By clicking the field before it turns green will result in a regular UI interaction.

    ![Robot input username locator select](images/robot-designer_smart-record_select-user-id.png "")

    The Targeting will map the `User ID` UI element value to the **Username locator** field in the robot.

    ![Robot input username locator select](images/robot-designer_username-locator_mapped.png "")

10. Repeat the previous steps for the following fields:

    * **Password locator**: Select the `password` UI element.
    * **Submit locator**: Select the `Sign In` button that the robot clicks to sign in to the Oracle Fusion application.

    Your intermediate Login action panel should look as follows:

    ![Current flow until sign-in](images/robot-designer_flow_sign-in-complete.png " ")

11. Click **OK**.

12. Above the Robot canvas, click **Save**.

## Task 5: Add Robot ERP Actions using the Record option

While building the rest of the robot, you'll record the actions that the robot completes using the recorder, all while harnessing the power of control and power of the low-code capabilities. We will navigate the Fusion pages using UI actions (e.g. mouse clicks, keyboard entries), which will automatically generate the relevant robot actions on the flow.

1. Open the browser window where the credentials were entered in the previous task. Click **Sign In** to proceed to the next screen in ERP Cloud.

    ![ERP Cloud login](images/erp-cloud_login.png " ")

    We will start the robot recording after the login screen.

2. Return to the browser tab running the robot designer. On the robot designer canvas, click the **Login** action to enable the record button.

3. Click the **Record after the selected option** button to start recording after the selected **Login** action.  ![Record button enabled](images/robot-designer_record-button.png " ")

4. On the **Smart Record** panel, click **Select browser tab to target** drop-down.

5. Select the window title which coincides with the ERP Cloud tab.

    ![Select browser tab](images/robot-designer_smart-record_select-browser.png " ")

    This starts the recorder on the ERP Cloud landing page.

6. On the **RPA Smart Recording** panel, click on **Begin Recording**.

    We will now select field elements to generate associated Actions in the robot.

    > **Note**: When recording actions, the recorder can start from any point in time. However, for this task we will record after the Login operation.

7. From the top menu in ERP Cloud, click on **Procurement** when the icon changes to a target. 

    ![Click Procurement target elements](images/robot-designer_smart-record_click-procurement.png " ")

8. In the **Action Details**, keep all values as default and click **Save**. This will add the action `Click "Procurement"` and move to the **Procurement** tab. If your element value is not `A`, then you clicked on the wrong element. Retry the action by selecting **Discard** and click **Procurement** target element again while using the recorder.

    ![Procurement action details](images/robot-designer_smart-record_procurement-action-details.png " ")

    > **Note:** When recording or targeting a field, hover your cursor over a UI element and note the shading that appears. While the the shading is purple and the icon above the field is a magnifying glass, the recorder is still collecting information about the element. Clicking the element before it turns green will result in a regular UI interaction.

9. Click on **Purchase Orders** when the complete tile is shaded and changed to a target. 

    ![Select Purchase Orders tile](images/robot-designer_smart-record_click-purchase-orders.png "=50%x*")

10. In the **Action Details**, keep all values as default and click **Save**. This will add the `Click "Purchase Orders"` action and move to the **Overview - Purchase Orders** screen. If your element value is not `DIV`, then you clicked on the wrong element. Retry the action by selecting **Discard** and click **Purchase Orders** target element again while using the recorder.

    ![Purchase Orders action details](images/robot-designer_smart-record_purchase-orders-action-details.png " ")

11. On the **Overview** page, move to the right of the screen and select the **Tasks** icon when the icon changes to a target.
    ![Select Tasks icon](images/erp-cloud_select-tasks.png " ")

    In the **Action Details**, keep all values as default and click **Save**. This will add the `Click "Tasks"` action and display a side panel.

    If your element value is not `DIV`, then you clicked on the wrong element. Retry the action by selecting **Discard** and click **Tasks** icon element again while using the recorder.

12. On the side panel, navigate to the **Orders** section and click on **Manage Orders** when the icon changes to a target. In the **Action Details**, keep all values as default and click **Save**. This will add the `Click "Manage Orders"` action.

    While adding the **Manage Orders** action, the side panel will typically close. This prevents the page from moving to the next screen. We will momentarily pause the recording.

13. Select **Pause** one the Smart Recording panel, click on **Tasks** icon, then select **Manage Orders** again. The screen will move to the **Manage Orders** overview screen.

    ![Pause Smart Recording](images/robot-designer_smart-record_pause.png "" )

    Next, we will search for a specific Purchase Order by providing an order number. Make sure to obtain a valid Purchase Order number before proceeding to the next step.

13. Move to the **Order** field and select the UI element when the icon changes to a target. Enter the following values in the **Action Details**.

    * Name: `Enter "PO number" Text`
    * Target name: Add something descriptive without spaces (such as `"Enter_po_number"`)
    * Value: In the field, click ![Select Flow button](images/action-details_po-number_flow-button.png " ") **(Flow Input/Output)** and select the **Input** property **PONumber**. Double-click the property to have it mapped to the **Value** field.
    * Test value: Enter a valid `PO Number` which will be used in the search query to pull an actual purchase order. Example: `US164712`

    ![PO Number action details](images/action-details_po-number.png " ")

12. Click **Save**.

13. Click on **Search** when the complete tile is shaded and changed to a target. In the **Action Details**, keep all values as default and click **Save**. This will add the `Click "Search"` action and display the search results containing the specified purchase order.

14. For the listed purchase order, move to the **Supplier** column and select the supplier name after the icon changes to a target. Enter the following values in the **Action Details**.
    * Name: `Click "Get supplier name"`
    * Action: Get Text
    * Save To: ![Select Flow button](images/action-details_output_flow-button.png " ") (**Output**) and double-click on **SupplierName**.
    ![Select Flow button](images/action-details_output_assign-supplier.png " ")

15. Click **Save**.

16. In the "Smart Recording" panel, click on ![Smart Recording stop button](images/smart-recording_stop-button.png " ") **(Stop recording)** to end the recording.

17. In the **Robot Designer**, click on **Save**.

    We will add a Log action to capture the output value of the robot.

18. Click on the **Robot actions** panel, and drag-and-drop the **Log** action to the tail end of the flow.
![Add Log action](images/robot-designer_add-log-action.png "")

19. On the **Log** panel, hover over the **Message** field, click **...** (More options), and select **Output**. This assigns the output value to the log message.
![Assign Log Output Message](images/robot-designer_log-action_assign-output.png "")

20. Drag the ```SupplierName``` property to **Message** field.
![Drag Supplier property](images/robot-designer_log-action_assign-supplier.png "")

21. Click **OK**, then **Save**.

22. Close the robot designer by clicking on the **< (Go back)** button on the top left of the screen.





    The status of your robot should change to **Configured**.

25. For the selected robot, click on **...** and select **Activate**.
