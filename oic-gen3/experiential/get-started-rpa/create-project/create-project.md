# Create a Project

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a Project to hold all the relevant Integration and Robot assets, such as connections and flows.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### About Projects

Projects are the hubs of all your automation work and the place to go when you want to design automation solutions, including integrations and robots. Each project can focus on a specific business objective, where select users are given access to project assets. Users who are on different teams and who have different skill-sets can collaborate on designated projects to meet their team objectives.

Projects provide convenient deployment and unified observability, allowing pre-defined teams to work together to build, deploy, and monitor integrations and robots.
