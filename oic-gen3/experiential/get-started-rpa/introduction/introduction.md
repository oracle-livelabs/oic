# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Estimated Time: 1 hour 30 minutes


### What is Robotic Process Automation?
 Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that allows for automation of mundane, tedious, rule based, error-prone, repetitive tasks that a large segment of an enterprise workforce has to deal with. As opposed to other flavors of Integration or Process/Task automation such as API or DB connector based integration/automation, RPA technology allows for creation of automation (robots) that simulates user actions on the application's user interface. For legacy system where APIs are not available or for systems where APIs are not accessible to the integrator, RPA is often the only automation solution.

RPA use cases are generally categorized by how the robots used – attended or unattended.

- Attended robots are like virtual assistants that assist individual employees with front-office tasks to boost personal productivity. Often, attended robots interact with applications on the employee’s desktop.

- Unattended robots automate back-office tasks and are invoked as part of larger end-to-end business process or integration flows. Unattended robots are just another technical option for connecting to systems of record – effectively like APIs.

### What is RPA in Oracle Integration 3?
RPA is available as a first-class feature in Oracle Integration 3 (OIC3). It provides a ubiquitous, low skill, and non-disruptive mechanism to connect to and operate on data sources. These data sources are interfaces that a user can interact with from their desktop. OIC-RPA provides a framework to connect to applications and data sources via a web browser interface.

### Terminology
| Term          | Definition    |
| ------------- |---------------|
| *RPA*  | A service that automates repetitive manual tasks involving humans  interacting with software systems. RPA accomplishes these automations by interacting with the software systems through the user interface in the same way as human users. |
| *Robot Project* | An organizational construct for managing the artifacts to perform a defined RPA automation. Project artifacts may include Flows, Flow Activities, Configurations, and Events. |
| *Robot Flow* | An orchestration of Robot Activities for the purpose of automating all or a portion of an interaction with a Client Application. |
|*RPA Adapter*| A Connectivity Service Adapter designed to discover, configure, and invoke Robot Automations. |
| *Robot Agent* | Communication channel between Robot Runtime and UI plane. |
|
