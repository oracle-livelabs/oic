# Create and Test an Integration

## Introduction

After ensuring the robot performs the UI tasks as expected, we will now create an integration that calls it. This integration simulates an end-to-end testing scenario, where the integration passes the input values to the robot.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create and run an integration which triggers the robot and passes input values.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Activated the robot
* Successfully tested the robot in its environment
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Create Integration


## Task 2: Run Integration to Call Robot
