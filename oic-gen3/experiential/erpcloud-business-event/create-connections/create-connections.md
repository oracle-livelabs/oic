# Create Connections

## Introduction
This demo lab will walk you through the steps to create connections for all the services which will used in the ERP Purchase Order Event integration.

Before you can build an integration, you have to create the connections to the applications with which you want to share data. Follow these steps to create an ERP Cloud connection.


Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Create an Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter Connection
- Create an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse connection

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- Completed the Lab Setup


## Task 1: Create an Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter connection
Create a connection with the Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Design*** &gt; ***Connections*** &gt; click ***Create***
2. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **Oracle ERP Cloud** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter `ERP` in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.

    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | `LLDemo_ERP`       |
    | Description  | `ERP Connection for LiveLabs demo` |
    |

    Keep all other values as default.

5. In the *Oracle ERP Cloud Connection* dialog, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |ERP Cloud Host | `your-erp-host-name` |
    |Security Policy | **Username Password Token**|

7. Click ***Save*** and wait for the confirmation box. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.



## Task 2: Create an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Connection
Create a connection with the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Design*** &gt; ***Connections*** &gt; click ***Create***

2. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **Oracle ADW** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter `Oracle` in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.
