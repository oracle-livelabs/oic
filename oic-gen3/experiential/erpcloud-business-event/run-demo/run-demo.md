## Task 2: Validate Purchase Order status
After the PO is submitted, the initial status becomes *Pending Approval*. The PO Create event will occur once the status changes to *Open*.

1. In the **Overview** section, click **Tasks** button on the right.

    This opens the *Tasks* menu.

3. Click **Search**. You should see the Purchase Orders for the current user.

4. Look for your Purchase Order in the list with the PO number displayed in the previous task.

    > **Tip:** The last created PO should generally be the top one in the list.

5. Validate the PO Status. If it's *Open* then the Business Event has occurred.

    > **Note:** If PO has another Status, such as *Pending Approval*, then wait a couple of minutes and keep refreshing the page until the desired PO Status appears.


## Task 3: Track message flow triggered by the PO Create Event
Use the Oracle Integration dashboard to see the data flow resulting from the create Purchase Order event in ERP Cloud.

1. In the Integration navigation pane, click **Home** &gt; **Observability** &gt; **Instances**

2. Find our corresponding Integration Instance, by matching the *PO Header Id* or *Document Description* from the Purchase Order in ERP Cloud. This should be under the columns *Primary Identifier* or *Business Identifiers*.

    ![Find the Integration Instance](images/integration-instance-run.png)

3. Click on your **PO Header Id** link to open the corresponding integration instance.

    ![Open the Integration Instance](images/integration-instance-open.png)

    The flow ran successfully if it is displayed with a green line.

    ![Completed integration flow](images/completed-integration-flow.png)

4. You can observe **Activity Stream** on the right side of the screen.

5. Click on the different **Message** links to review the flow of request and response messages.

6. Click **Go back** to go back to the instances.


## Task 4: Verify PO record in ADW Table
Follow these steps to view the PO record in the designated DB table.

1. If you are not already logged in to Oracle Cloud Console, log in and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** from the navigation menu.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/adb-navigation.png)

    > **Note:** You can also directly access your Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing service in the **Quick Actions** section of the dashboard.

2. Navigate into your demo database by clicking on the instance link.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/select-adb-instance.png)

    > **Note:** Similar steps apply to either Autonomous Data Warehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing.

3. In your ADW Database Details page, click the **Database Actions** button.

    ![Select Autonomous Database](../setup/images/click-database-actions.png)

4. Sign-in with your database instance's default administrator account, Username = `ADMIN` and click **Next**.

    ![Enter DB username](../setup/images/enter-username.png)

5.  Enter the **ADMIN** password and click **Sign in**.

    ![Enter DB password](../setup/images/enter-password.png)

6. The Database Actions page opens. In the *Development* box, click **SQL**.

    ![Open SQL](../setup/images/open-sql.png)


7. The SQL Worksheet appears. In the *Navigator* on the left, select the **PURCHASEORDER** table, then right-click on **Open**.
