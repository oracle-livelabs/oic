# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows you how to design and develop File-based Data Integration (FBDI) Import usecase in Oracle Integration 3 with the ERP Cloud. Out of the box, ERP Cloud adapter helps an Integration developer to quickly import the data into the ERP Cloud in a secured way using various authentication schemes

Estimated Time: 2 hours

### What is Oracle Integration 3?

With Oracle Integration 3 (OIC), you have the power to *integrate* your cloud and on-premises applications, *automate* business processes, *gain insight* into your business processes, visually *develop* web and mobile applications, use an SFTP-compliant file server to *store* and *retrieve* files, and *exchange* business documents with a B2B trading partner—all in one place.

## Leverage the ERP Cloud Adapter in Oracle Integration 3

Oracle Integration 3 provides native connectivity to Oracle and non-Oracle Software as a Service (SaaS) and On-premises applications, such as Oracle ERP Cloud, Oracle Service Cloud, HCM Cloud, Salesforce.com, Workday, EBS, SAP, NetSuite and so on. OIC adapters simplify connectivity by handling the underlying complexities of connecting to applications using industry-wide best practices

With the help of this cookbook series, you can design and implement ERP Cloud Integration patterns leveraging Oracle Integration 3 features and functionalities

As an Integration Developer, if you have a requirement to integrate an ERP Cloud application with any other SaaS or On-premise application, then this cookbook series helps you to go through the pre-requisite steps, common use cases, ERP Cloud adapter functional capabilities and several implementation considerations along with lab exercises to provide hands-on experience.

The Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter enables you to easily integrate on-premises or SaaS applications with Oracle ERP Cloud without having to know about the specific details involved in the integration.

The Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter provides the following key benefits:
- Provides declarative support for subscribing to business events raised by various modules in Oracle ERP Cloud and Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud.
- Integrates easily with the Oracle ERP Cloud application’s WSDL file to produce a simplified, integration-centric WSDL.
- Generates automatic mapping to the selected business object, event subscription, or business (REST) API.
- Simplifies connection creation by automatically identifying the required service resources based on the Oracle ERP Cloud hostname you specify when creating a new connection on the **Connections** page.
- Supports several security policies for selection during Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter connection configuration:
    - Username Password Token With PGP Key Support
    - Username Password Token
    - OAuth Authorization Code Credentials
- Provides standard error handling capabilities.
- Enables you to upload a file in the Oracle ERP Cloud business tables.
- Enables you to upload files to Oracle WebCenter Content (Universal Content Manager) in encrypted or unencrypted format.
