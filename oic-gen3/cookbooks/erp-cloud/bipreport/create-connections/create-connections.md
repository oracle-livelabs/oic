# Create and Configure Connections

## Introduction


This lab will walk you through the steps to create connections for all the services which will be used in the Integration Flow.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Create REST connection using REST adapter
- Create ERP Cloud External Report Service connection using SOAP adapter

    > **Note:**  You can use an existing connection if one has already been configured for your environment.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- Completed all the previous labs


##	Task	1: Create REST Connection using REST adapter
Create a connection with the REST Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane of OIC, Click ***Design*** &gt; ***Connections*** and Click ***Create***.
2. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **REST** adapter. To find the adapter, enter *REST* in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.
3. In the *Create Connection* dialog, enter the following information and click on ***Create***:

    | **Field**        | **Value**          |       
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | REST Interface     |
    | Role         | Trigger       |

    Keep all other values as default.

4. In the *Configuration* page, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |Security Policy | OAuth 2.0 Or Basic Authentication |

5. Click on ***Test***  and wait until you receive a confirmation box that the test was successful.
6. Click ***Save*** and wait for the confirmation box. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.


## Task 2: Create ERP Cloud External Report Service Connection using SOAP Adapter

To access the File Server from an Integration, you will need to create an FTP Connection.  

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Design*** &gt; ***Connections*** &gt; click ***Create***
2. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **SOAP** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter *SOAP* in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter
3. From the *Create Connection* dialog, enter the following information and click on ***Create***:

    > **Note:**  If you get an error that the identifier already exists, enter unique connection name and remember this name for use later in the workshop.

    | **Field**        | **Value**          |       
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | `ERP Cloud External Report Service`       |
    | Description  | `ERP Cloud External Report Service for OIC LiveLabs` |

    Keep all other values as default.

4. In the *Configuration* page, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |WSDL URL | enter ***https://ERPCloudHost/xmlpserver/services/ExternalReportWSSService?WSDL*** |
    |Security Policy | select ***Basic Authentication*** |
    |Username | Enter ***Enter ERP Cloud username received from the instructor*** |
    |Username | Enter ***Enter ERP Cloud password received from the instructor*** |


5. Confirm your Connection by clicking ***Test***, then ***Validate & Test***. You should see the *Connection ERP Cloud External Report Service was tested successfully.* confirmation message. Click ***Save*** and exit the Connection editor.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
