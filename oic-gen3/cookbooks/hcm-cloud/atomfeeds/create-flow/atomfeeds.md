# AtomFeeds Integration Flow

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Integration flow.

This use case explores how to use of Oracle Integration 3 with Oracle HCM REST and ATOM services to provide information to an identity management system hosted by a customer

 The following diagram shows the interaction between the systems involved in this use case.
    ![directory-synchronization](../images/directory-synchronization.png)

Estimated Time: 50 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Connect to HCM Cloud to extract new hire information and push it to the downstream application.
* You would be using HCL Cloud adapter, FTP adapter and Stage File action

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs successfully completed.

## Task 1: Create the Directory Synchronization Integration

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Design*** &gt; ***Integrations***.
2. On the **Integrations page**, click ***Create***.
3. On the **Integration Style** dialog, select ***Scheduled orchestration***, followed by ***Create***
4. In the **Create New Integration** dialog, enter the following information:

    | **Element**          | **Value**          |       
    | --- | ----------- |
    |Name | Directory Synchronization |
    |Description | This integration shows you how to use the HCM Cloud adapter with the FTP adapter to generate a file for Identity Management. |

    Accept all other default values.

5. Click ***Create***.
6. Optional, Select Layout to ***Horizontal*** and Click ***Save*** to apply changes.

## Task 2: Configure the Schedule action
1. Select **Schedule** action and click on **...** and click on **Edit**
2. Click on **+** icon, enter the parameter name as ***ATOMLastRunDateTime*** and enter the default value as ***2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z***
3. Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers.

## Take 3: Schedule the Next ATOM Polling
Schedule the current ATOM polling to the current date and time. The next time the integration runs, this will be the ATOMLastRunDateTime variable.
1. Click **Actions** icon which is there on the right side of the screen and from the **Actions** section, drag ***Assign*** to the Integration canvas, and place it after the **Schedule** activity.
    The Configure assign dialog appears
2. In the **Name** field, enter ***assignCurrentTimeStamp***, Click on **+** icon, Select **String**,
In the **Variable** field, enter ***ts***, In the **Value** field (click on **switch to developer view** icon if, required), enter expression as ***fn:concat(fn:substring-before(/ics:schedule/ics:startTime, "."), ".000Z")***

    > **Note:**  Expression given above might not work as is, you might need to build such expression and drag and drop the components from the functions pallet and variables. For this, you need to drag concat function, substring-before and then startTime from left side to Value text field which is under configuration section.

3. Click on ***Apply***, Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers

## Take 4: Access the HCM Cloud ATOM Feed
Let's use the HCM Cloud adapter to access the HCM Cloud ATOM feed.
1. Hover over the outgoing arrow for the **assignCurrentTimeStamp** activity and click **+** icon
2. Search for **HCM Cloud** and select it.
3. On the **Basic Info** page,
    - for the **What do you want to call your endpoint?** element, enter ***getNewHireATOMFeed***
    - Click ***&gt; (Next step)***.
4. On the **Actions** page,
    - select ***Subscribe to Updates (via ATOM Feed)***
    - Click ***&gt; (Next step)***.
5. On the **Operations** page,
      - from the **Select an ATOM Feed** list, select ***Employee New Hire***
      - Scroll down, From the **Max entries to process** list, select ***250***
    > **Note:**  This ensures that most customers have all their new hires appear in the ATOM Feed response.

7. Click ***&gt; (Next step)*** and Review the summary and click ***Done***
8. Click ***Save*** to persist changes

## Take 5: Define the Data Mapping
A Map action named **Map getNewHireATOMFeed** is automatically created. We'll define this data mapping.
1. Select the **Map getNewHireATOMFeed action** and click on **...** and click on **Edit**
2. In the **Target** section, expand **Application Pull Parameter**
3. Map the **ATOMLastRunDateTime** field in the Sources section, to the **Updated Min** field in the Target section.
   To map an element, select the element from the Sources section, then while clicking your mouse move it towards the target element. When you reach the target element the line turns green and a check mark appears.
4. Click on ***Validate***
5. Click ***&lt; (Go back)***
6. Click ***Save*** to persist changes


## Take 6: Count the New Hires
The ATOM feed doesn't return the total number of new hires, so we'll configure an assign action to calculate the number of new hires.
1. Click **Actions** icon which is there on the right side of the screen and from the **Actions** section, drag ***Assign*** to the Integration canvas, and place it after the **Invoke getNewHireATOMFeed** activity

2. In the **Name** field, enter ***newHiresCount***, Click on **+** icon, Select **String**, In the **Variable** field, enter ***countOfNewHires***. In the **Value** field (click on **switch to developer view** icon if, required), drag and drop ***count*** function from the functions palette and then drag ***EmployeeNewHireFeed__Update*** inside the Count function. It should look like ***count($getNewHireATOMFeed/ns17:EmployeeNewHireFeedResponse/ns17:EmployeeNewHireFeed_Update)***

    ![newhirescount](../images/newhirescount.png)
3. Click on ***Apply***, Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers

## Take 7: Add Switch activity to check for New Records
Let's check if the ATOM feed returned new records, and define what to do next.
1. Click **Actions** icon and from the **Logic** section, drag ***Switch*** to the Integration canvas and place it after the **newHiresCount** activity.
    Two flow branches appear in the flow:
    - Undefined: this branch checks the countOfNewHires. If the expression evaluates to true, the instance follows the flow in this branch.
    - Otherwise: the instance follows this branch when the routing expression for the initial branch resolves to false.

2. Use fit to page option for a complete view of the integration flow.
    ![fittopage](../images/fittopage.png)


## Take 8: Define the IF conditional flow
1. Select Undefined, click on **...** and click on **Edit**, The Expression Builder appears.
2. Define an expression to check if the ATOM feed contains any new hires:
    - In the Expression Name field, enter **no new hires**.
    - In the Source section, select $countOfNewHires.
        The $countOfNewHires variable appears in the first part of the expression, and a green check mark appears next to the variable
    - In the New Condition box, enter ***0.0*** in the field after the equal operator.
3. Click on Apply, Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers
    ![nonew-hires](../images/nonew-hires.png)
4. Click **Actions** icon and from the **End** section, drag ***Stop*** to the Integration canvas and place it after the **IF no new hires** activity.
    This lets the integration complete if there aren't any new hires.

## Take 9: Define the Otherwise Flow
1. Click **Actions** icon and from the **Actions** section, drag ***Assign*** to the Integration canvas and place it after the **Otherwise** activity.
    The Create Action dialog appears.
    This assign activity creates a temporary variable to store the file reference of a stage file activity.
2. In the **Name** field, enter ***StageFileRef***, Click on **+** icon, Select **String**, In the **Variable** field, enter ***tempStageFileRef***, In the **Value** field(click on **switch to developer view** icon if, required), enter expression as ***""***
3. Click on Apply, Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers

## Take 10: Process the Records
Let's iterate over the new hires that you got from the ATOM feed in a JSON file, and retrieve the record for each new hire using the HCM Cloud REST service.
1. Click **Actions** icon and from the **Logic** section, drag ***For Each*** to the Integration canvas and place it after the **StageFileRef** activity
    The Create Action dialog appears.
2. In the **Name** field, enter ***ForEachEntry***
3. From **Sources** section, Expand **$getNewHireATOMFeed**, expand **EmployeeNewHireFeedResponse** and Select **EmployeeNewHireFeed_Update**, drag and drop on **Repeating Element** section
4. Enter ***CurEntry*** as a **Current element name**
4. Click on Apply, Click ***Save*** to apply changes and click on main canvas so that child window disappers
