### Get Started

Process Automation is available in two models - as an individual or standalone Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service, and as a service paired with a Fusion-based Cloud application (such as HCM Cloud or CX Cloud). For information about these service types, see [Service Types](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/process-automation&id=PRADM-GUID-29821BED-7F66-495A-879C-04688C54454E).

The service has two environments:

  - **Design time** (Designer): for developing, testing, and activating process applications
  - **Runtime** (Workspace): for running, monitoring, and managing activated applications
